# Program-to-Check-Prime-Number
This Python script allows users to check whether a given number is prime or not.
It prompts the user to enter a number
Checks if it is equal to 1 (which is not a prime number)
Then proceeds to check if the number is greater than 1 and whether it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 
If the number meets the criteria of being a prime number, the script prints a message indicating that it is prime.
